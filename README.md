## Setup
To run this:
1. First connect your Dexcom device/Nightscout to sugarmate if you havn't already. (enter sugarmate.io, create an account and follow the steps. should be easy enough)
2. When the program first runs, you will be prompted with a screen asking for the Sugarmate API URL. this can be obtained from https://sugarmate.io/home/settings. go to this url, scroll all the way down and you will see some URL under "External json". copy this URL and paste it to the application.
3. Enjoy!


**if for any reason you want to change json url (the url you pasted into the applocation), it is is stored in c:/Users/*yourUser*/AppData/local/SugarReader.
